## Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms related to cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital investigations.

## Blockchain Technology

### Address
A unique identifier that serves as a virtual location where cryptocurrency can be sent to and from, similar to an email address or bank account number.

### Altcoin
Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Examples include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

### Block
A collection of transaction data that is added to the blockchain. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, creating a chain.

### Block Explorer
A web tool that allows users to search and navigate the blockchain, viewing transactions, addresses, and blocks.

### Block Height
The number of blocks preceding a particular block in the blockchain. The genesis block has a height of zero.

### Block Reward
The cryptocurrency awarded to a miner when they successfully add a new block to the blockchain.

### Blockchain
A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across many computers. Once recorded, the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively.

### Cold Storage

### Consensus Mechanism
The process by which a network of nodes reaches agreement on the state of a blockchain. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.

### Cryptocurrency
A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a blockchain.

### Cryptography
The practice of secure communication techniques used to protect information from third parties.

### Decentralization
The distribution of power away from a central authority. In blockchain, this means no single entity controls the network.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
A consensus mechanism where validators are selected to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

### Proof of Work (PoW)
A consensus mechanism that requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.
